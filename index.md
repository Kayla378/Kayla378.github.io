I am a criminal justice major and minoring in computer science at CSUF and I plan on graduting in 2027.

##favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

*Lab 3 

This was one of my favorite parts during this lab I was able to create and utilized fucntions with estimating the calculations of BMR (Basal, Metabolic Rate) using equations to pass parameters for weight, age, height, return calculations results, and using these equations addresses real world problems.

*Lab 7 Part 2

This was also another favorite, I got to learn how to calculate the total score of a blackjack, check valid card names, and the validation of arguments. Also didn't know what majority of the card vaules were till I looked back through the read me to see how much each card was vauled. 

*Lab 11, Part 1

This was a favorite because I got to learn how to compute the number of population, look through states with high and low densities, read date using the cvs file. This was solving a lot with algorithms problem solving which is always something interest my learning.
